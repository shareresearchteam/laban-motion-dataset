# Laban Motion Based Arm Trajectories
A dataset collected to detect qualities of expressivity in robotic arm trajectories. Files are named by <Participant#>_<Condition>.csv with condition labels being one of 8 specific styles based on  the Laban Effort poles: 
- A --> Strong
- B --> Light
- C --> Direct
- D -->Indirect
- E--> Free
- F --> Bound
- G --> Sustained 
- H ---> Sudden


## Folders
- **raw_data:** Raw trajectories of robot motion with measured joint positions, velocities, and efforts in an array. 8 Joint values are listed from the end-effector actuators backward to the first joint.     
- **processed_data:** Extracted Features From Raw Trajectories for the reported datasets of LASSO reduced sets for comparisons between
